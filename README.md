This project is designed to predict the chances of admission for students into universities based on various factors. The dataset used contains details like GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, and more. A machine learning model is trained to make predictions regarding the likelihood of a student getting admitted to their desired program.

Key Features:
Dataset: The project uses a dataset consisting of student records with various features, such as GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, etc.
Target Variable: The target variable is the "Chance of Admission," which the model attempts to predict.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Multiple machine learning models, including regression and classification algorithms, were tested and compared to find the best-fit model.
Exploratory Data Analysis: The project includes a comprehensive EDA section to visualize correlations between different features and their impact on admission chances.
Model Training: The notebook explores model training, tuning, and evaluation.
Performance Evaluation: The performance of the models is measured using metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, and RÂ².
Tools and Libraries:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas, NumPy for data handling
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for model building
Objectives:
To understand the key factors that influence admission chances.
To build a predictive model with high accuracy.
To provide insights into the admissions process.
